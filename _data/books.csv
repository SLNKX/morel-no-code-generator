,KWGDZX2V,book,2022,"Pillai, Meena T.",Affective Feminisms in Digital India: Intimate Rebels,,978-1-003-31465-3,,,,"This book studies digital feminist activism in contemporary India. It provides a close and comprehensive analysis of the postmillennial digital moment in India which has given rise to new modes of women’s digital dissent. The volume examines how anti-rape narratives, Feminichy scandals, #MeToo movements, and menstrual activisms, amongst a host of other performative feminist dissent and their discursive medialities create ‘affective digital feminisms’ which both break with and continue the residual and emergent practices within feminisms in India. It looks at digital womanspeak from India and focuses on vernacular forms of dissent, through which the author aims to decolonize feminist imaginaries from their moorings in the West. The author explores new digital, cultural, and social geographies where politically untamed women use their precarity to unsettle deep sexist structures and mount a gendered critique of the political economy of the nation state.   An important contribution to the study of feminism in India, the volume will be useful for students and researchers of gender and women’s studies, cultural studies, digital sociology, intersectional feminism, transnational feminism, digital humanities, and South Asian studies. It will also be appeal to readers interested in the history of women’s dissent in India.",2022-09-28,2025-10-14 21:34:28,2025-10-14 21:34:28,,,248.0,,,,,Affective Feminisms in Digital India,,,,,Routledge India,London,,,,,,,,DOI: 10.4324/9781003314653,,C:\Users\Slenk\OneDrive - University of Virginia\Zotero UVA\Pillai - 2022 - Affective Feminisms in Digital India Intimate Rebels.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,LYEP5ULS,book,2023,"Galvan, Margaret",In Visible Archives: Queer and Feminist Visual Culture in the 1980s,,978-1-4529-6982-4,,,https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/23/oa_monograph/book/111110,"Analyzing how 1980s visual culture provided a vital space for women artists to theorize and visualize their own bodies and sexualities In 1982, the protests of antiporn feminists sparked the censorship of the Diary of a Conference on Sexuality, a radical and sexually evocative image-text volume whose silencing became a symbol for the irresolvable feminist sex wars. In Visible Archives documents the community networks that produced this resonant artifact and others, analyzing how visual culture provided a vital space for women artists to theorize and visualize their own bodies and sexualities.  Margaret Galvan explores a number of feminist and cultural touchstones—the feminist sex wars, the HIV/AIDS crisis, the women in print movement, and countercultural grassroots periodical networks—and examines how visual culture interacts with these pivotal moments. She goes deep into the records to bring together a decade’s worth of research in grassroots and university archives that include comics, collages, photographs, drawings, and other image-text media produced by women, including Hannah Alderfer, Beth Jaker, Marybeth Nelson, Roberta Gregory, Lee Marrs, Alison Bechdel, Gloria Anzaldúa, and Nan Goldin.  The art highlighted in In Visible Archives demonstrates how women represented their bodies and sexualities on their own terms and created visibility for new, diverse identities, thus serving as blueprints for future activism and advocacy—work that is urgent now more than ever as LGBTQ+ and women’s rights face challenges and restrictions across the nation.",2023,2025-10-15 16:52:24,2025-10-15 16:52:24,2025-10-15 16:52:24,,,,,,,In Visible Archives,,,,,University of Minnesota Press,Minneapolis,,,,,,Project MUSE,,,,C:\Users\Slenk\OneDrive - University of Virginia\Zotero UVA\Galvan - 2023 - In Visible Archives Queer and Feminist Visual Culture in the 1980s.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is present the relation between art history and network analysis, but it does not have any relation with DH methods, further that explains how internet is a network itself. The authors mention how women has been unrepresented in AH citing classical British works like Pollock and Chadwick but this approximation to the field feels short. There are questions about women networks and their characteristic differences with male networks or mixed networks. There is not a discussion in what the author understands as a woman and the feminist cited is all second wave. It feels short in current discussions of gender and identity, and it never mentions intersectionality or other critical approaches from feminism.",,C:\Users\Slenk\OneDrive - University of Virginia\Zotero UVA\Camus and Dupont - 2018 - Women in Art and Literature Networks Spinning Webs.pdf; C:\Users\Slenk\Zotero\storage\G4A7XRFI\detail.html,,,Women and the arts.; Women art critics--Social networks.; Women art dealers--Social networks.; Women art patrons--Social networks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The figure of the guerrilla appears in digital humanities’ recent history as an agent of tactical reformation. It refers to a broad swath of disciplinary desires: digital humanities’ claim to collaborative and inclusive pedagogy, minimal and encrypted computing, and a host of minoritarian political interventions in its praxis, including queer politics, critical race studies, and feminist theory.  In this penetrating study, Matthew Applegate uses the guerrilla to connect popular iterations of digital humanities’ practice to its political rhetoric and infrastructure. By doing so, he reorients DH’s conceptual lexicon around practices of collective becoming, mediated by claims to conflict, antagonism, and democratic will.  Applegate traces Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri’s radical democratic ingresses into network theory, the guerrilla’s role in its discourse, and concerns for the digital humanities’ own invocation of the figure. The book also connects post- and decolonial, feminist, and Marxist iterations of DH praxis to the aesthetic histories of movements such  as Latin American Third Cinema and the documentary cinema of the Black Panther Party. Concluding with a meditation on contemporary political modalities inherent in DH’s disciplinary expansion, Guerrilla Theory challenges the current political scope of the digital humanities and thus its future institutional impact.",2019,2025-11-18 20:42:48,2025-11-18 20:42:48,2025-11-18 20:42:48,,,,,,,Guerrilla Theory,,,,,Northwestern University Press,Evanston,,,,,,Project MUSE,,,,"C:\Users\Slenk\OneDrive - University of Virginia\Zotero UVA\Applegate - 2019 - Guerrilla Theory Political Concepts, Critical Digital Humanities.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
